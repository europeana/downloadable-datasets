# Downloadable CHO data sets generator 
This project uses the [Europeana OAI-PMH service](https://api.europeana.eu/oai/record/) to periodically harvest all
 Cultural Heritage Objects (CHOs) in the Europeana database and turn them into compressed sets so people can
 download those.

<b>Please do not use this software to generate your own sets because this will 
will take multiple days to complete and requires more than 500 GB of disk space.</b> 

Instead you can download the sets via http://download.europeana.eu/ All sets are updated on a weekly basis.
